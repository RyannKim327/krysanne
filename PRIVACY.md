## 📞 1. Mental Health & Support Disclaimer

**Krysanne is an AI companion chatbot. It is NOT a licensed medical, mental health, or psychiatric professional service.** 

*   **Not a Replacement for Professional Help:** Krysanne cannot diagnose, treat, or prevent mental health conditions, and cannot provide clinical crisis intervention.
*   **Emergency Contact:** If you are experiencing a severe mental health crisis, self-harm thoughts, or suicidal thoughts, please reach out immediately to professional hotlines, emergency services, or local crisis centers:

## 🔒 2. Information We Collect

To provide a context-aware and fluid conversation, Krysanne collects and holds conversational information. **The data gathered is used strictly for continuous communication.** To prevent unauthorized local system access and ensure continuity across server updates/restarts, this data is saved securely to a private GitHub Secret Gist.

We collect:
1.  **Telegram Identifiers:** Your Telegram `chat.id`, `user.id`, and thread identifier (if using group topics) to associate conversation history with your current chat session.
2.  **Conversational History:** The text of messages you send to Krysanne, along with the assistant's replies.

*No other personal data (such as your real name, phone number, location, or payment details) is requested, processed, or stored by Krysanne.*

## ⚙️ 3. How We Use and Process Your Data

Your data is processed and used strictly for the following purposes:
*   **Conversational Continuity (Context):** Storing previous messages in the secure GitHub Secret Gist allows Krysanne to remember what was said earlier, facilitating natural, continuous, and supportive dialogue.
*   **AI Inference:** Messages are sent securely to the **OpenRouter AI** API (default model: `tencent/hy3:free` or equivalent) to generate empathetic responses, but are not stored or retained permanently on any other external platform.

---

## 💾 4. Data Storage and Retention

*   **GitHub Secret Gist Data Store:** Conversation histories and Telegram identifiers are stored securely in a private, secure GitHub Gist (configured via `GIST_ID` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`). This data persists across server restarts so that your conversations are not lost.
*   **No Centralized Database/Ad Profiling:** We do not upload or save your chats to any centralized cloud database, profiling engine, or advertising network. The Gist remains private and fully under the control of the hosting administrator.
*   **Cryptographic Protection (Future Updates):** To ensure ultimate confidentiality of the stored logs, an encryptor utilizing `json-enc-dec` is imported and will be applied in future updates. This will encrypt all conversational history contents written to the Gist store.
*   **User-Controlled Erasure:** You have complete control over your data.
    *   You can delete your history at any time by triggering the `clear-chat` command (e.g., by asking the bot to reset or clear the chat history).
    *   This instantly removes your user entry and history from the GitHub Secret Gist and, if applicable, deletes the Telegram forum thread.
