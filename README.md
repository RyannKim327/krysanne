> **"What I aim is to give people a friend, to prevent suicide cases. To call someone who listen to them."**
> — *Krysanne Mission Statement*

**Krysanne** is an empathetic, always-on AI assistant hosted on Telegram. This chatbot acts as a companion designed to listen, converse, and offer a supportive presence for individuals who may feel isolated, distressed, or simply need a safe space to share their thoughts. Powered by **OpenRouter AI** models, Krysanne aims to provide comfort and human-like warmth to prevent loneliness and mental health crises.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disclaimer:** Krysanne is an AI companion meant to lend a supportive ear and offer temporary comfort. It is **not** designed to replace physical human touch, real relationships, or professional help/counseling for emotional distress and mental health problems.
> 
> **Crisis Support Hotline (Philippines):** If you are experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please immediately contact **(02) 8804-4673** (Hopeline Philippines; Homepage: [findahelpline.com/organizations/hopeline](https://findahelpline.com/organizations/hopeline)) or visit [findahelpline.com/countries/ph](https://findahelpline.com/countries/ph) for more hotlines.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Empathetic Listening:** Engineered to act as a supportive companion, offering active listening and a compassionate outlet for users.
*   **Persistent Chat Memory (GitHub Secret Gist):** Retains conversational context securely per Telegram `chat.id` using a secure, private GitHub Secret Gist. This keeps data private and ensures chat history persists across server restarts.
*   **Planned Data Encryption:** An encryptor layer (utilizing the `json-enc-dec` package and `BOT_CODE` key) is currently prepared and will be fully applied in future updates to encrypt conversational logs in the Gist store, ensuring maximum cryptographic privacy.
*   **Dynamic Command Routing:** Commands generated in structured AI JSON responses are dynamically matched, imported, and executed from modular scripts in the `src/script/` directory.
*   **Extensible Built-in Commands:**
    *   `clear-chat`: Resets/clears the conversational history for a fresh start.
    *   `verse`: Scrapes and retrieves motivational Bible verses based on user request/state.
    *   `guitar`: Searches and fetches song lyrics and guitar chords when users want to play music.
    *   `imgen`: Generates stunning images on the fly via the Lumenfall API.
    *   `new-thread`: Creates and manages new Telegram forum topics dynamically.
    *   `weather`: Fetches real-time weather reports for a given city or location via wttr.in.
*   **Flexible Setup:** Supports both production-ready **Webhooks** (using Express) and rapid-development **Long Polling**.
*   **OpenRouter Integration:** Leverages any free or premium LLMs available through OpenRouter (defaults to `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free`).

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Telegram Integration:** [node-telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api)
*   **Web Framework:** [Express 5](https://expressjs.com/) (for webhook setup)
*   **API Client:** [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (to communicate with OpenRouter)

## 🎨 Web Design Philosophy

The companion platform frontend features a sleek, premium, and highly-focused design system that reflects Krysanne's comforting and gentle persona:

*   **Floating Capsule Navigation:** The header floats centered at the top of the page, adopting a Tailwind-style `rounded-full` layout. This ensures a clean, isolated, and floating web component aesthetic.
*   **Dynamic Color States:**
    *   **Muted Translucent State:** When resting at the top of the page, the header features a dark, semi-transparent backdrop blur (`rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.6)`) to stay unobtrusive and integrate with the dark-themed background.
    *   **Solid White State:** Upon scrolling the window down or opening the mobile drawer menu, the header transitions smoothly to solid white with dark navigation links and icons, offering high contrast and focused usability.
*   **Compassionate Visual Imagery:** The user interface features soft navy, violet, and starlight-white accents with cosmic/holographic glowing spheres to instill a sense of calm, technology, and support.

## 🤖 JSON-Driven Command Routing

Krysanne communicates in a structured JSON format to coordinate conversation and perform actions. Every response is parsed by a Markdown/JSON extractor to route command execution:

```json
{
  "message": "A human-readable explanation or chat response.",
  "command": "clear-chat | verse | guitar | imgen | new-thread | weather | (empty)",
  "parameter": "Arguments or search query for the command",
  "title": "Optional topic title (e.g., for creating or renaming forum topics)"
}
```

This design dynamically triggers scripts in `src/script/` corresponding to the command name (e.g., `imgen` will dynamically load and run `src/script/imgen.ts`).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

You will also need:
*   A **Telegram Bot Token** from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
*   An **OpenRouter API Key** from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

---

### 2. Installation

Clone this repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RyannKim327/krysanne
cd krysanne
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here

# OpenRouter AI API Configuration
AI_TOKEN=your_openrouter_api_key_here

# Bot Code (Secret key for hashing/encryption of conversational logs, reserved for future encryptor updates)
BOT_CODE=your_bot_secret_code_here

# Lumenfall AI API Key (Required for the `imgen` command)
LUMENFALL_API=your_lumenfall_api_key_here

# GitHub Secret Gist Data Store Configuration
GIST_ID=your_secret_gist_id_here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here

# Optional: Webhook Configuration (Leave empty to use polling mode)
# WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com
# PORT=3000
```

---

### 4. Running the Bot

To start the bot in development or production mode, run:

```bash
npm start
```

If `WEBHOOK_URL` is omitted, the bot will fall back automatically to **long polling** mode and log the status to the console.

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety

We take user privacy and emotional safety seriously. Krysanne is not a substitute for professional mental health support or physical human connection, but rather an AI companion to provide a temporary, listening hand during difficult moments. 

*   **Crisis Hotline:** If you are experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please call **(02) 8804-4673** (Hopeline Philippines; Homepage: [findahelpline.com/organizations/hopeline](https://findahelpline.com/organizations/hopeline)) or visit [findahelpline.com/countries/ph](https://findahelpline.com/countries/ph) for local hotlines.
*   **Privacy & Data Storage:** Conversational data is used strictly for continuous communication and is stored securely in a private GitHub Secret Gist. This prevents local storage exposure and ensures data persists across server restarts. To protect your data, an encryptor utilizing `json-enc-dec` is being integrated and will be applied in future updates to cryptographically encrypt all conversational logs.

For full details on data handling and mental health crisis disclaimers, please refer to our [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).
