> **"What I aim is to give people a friend, to prevent suicide cases. To call someone who listen to them."**
> — *TeleAI Mission Statement*

**TeleAI** is an empathetic, always-on AI assistant hosted on Telegram. Named **Krysanne**, this chatbot acts as a companion designed to listen, converse, and offer a supportive presence for individuals who may feel isolated, distressed, or simply need a safe space to share their thoughts. Powered by **OpenRouter AI** models, TeleAI aims to provide comfort and human-like warmth to prevent loneliness and mental health crises.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Empathetic Listening:** Engineered to act as a supportive companion, offering active listening and a compassionate outlet for users.
*   **Continuous Chat Memory:** Stores conversational context securely per Telegram `chat.id` in a local dataset to enable fluid, context-aware dialogues.
*   **Intelligent Built-in Commands:** Seamlessly parses commands embedded in AI responses (e.g., automatically clears the chat history when a user requests a fresh start).
*   **Flexible Setup:** Supports both production-ready **Webhooks** (using Express) and rapid-development **Long Polling**.
*   **OpenRouter Integration:** Leverages any free or premium LLMs available through OpenRouter (such as `openrouter/free`).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

You will also need:
*   A **Telegram Bot Token** from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
*   An **OpenRouter API Key** from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

### 2. Installation

Clone this repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RyannKim327/Tele-AI
cd TeleAI
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here

# OpenRouter AI API Configuration
AI_TOKEN=your_openrouter_api_key_here

# Optional: Webhook Configuration (Leave empty to use polling mode)
# WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com
# PORT=3000
```

---

### 4. Running the Bot

To start the bot in development or production mode, run:

```bash
npm start
```

If `WEBHOOK_URL` is omitted, the bot will fall back automatically to **long polling** mode and log the status to the console.
